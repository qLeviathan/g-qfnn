## Code Comparison

### Transformer Attention

```python
def attention(query, key, value):
    # Compute attention scores
    scores = torch.matmul(query, key.transpose(-2, -1)) / math.sqrt(d_k)
    
    # Apply softmax normalization
    attention_weights = F.softmax(scores, dim=-1)
    
    # Weighted aggregation
    output = torch.matmul(attention_weights, value)
    
    return output, attention_weights
```

### Repulsion Attention

```python
def repulsion_attention(states_i, states_j, values):
    # Extract coordinates
    ln_r_i, theta_i, z_i = states_i[..., 0], states_i[..., 1], states_i[..., 2]
    ln_r_j, theta_j, z_j = states_j[..., 0], states_j[..., 1], states_j[..., 2]
    
    # Compute resonance
    resonance = torch.abs(
        torch.exp(ln_r_i) * torch.cos(theta_i) - 
        torch.exp(ln_r_j) * torch.sin(theta_j) + 
        PHI / 2
    )
    
    # Compute repulsion strength
    repulsion = torch.exp(-resonance**2 / (2 * temperature))
    
    # Navigation instead of aggregation
    evolved_states = three_step_evolution(states_i, states_j, repulsion)
    
    # Born rule normalization
    evolved_states = enforce_born_rule(evolved_states)
    
    return evolved_states

## Conclusion

Repulsion Attention represents not merely an improvement to transformers but a fundamental paradigm shift in how we conceptualize neural architectures. By inverting the core assumption that tokens should attract, and by implementing a physics-first approach based on quantum field dynamics, Repulsion Attention offers a new direction that:

1. Drastically reduces memory requirements from O(N²) to O(N)
2. Eliminates the need for backpropagation
3. Preserves semantic diversity through repulsive dynamics
4. Creates naturally interpretable representations
5. Enables continuous learning without catastrophic forgetting

The transition from transformers to Repulsion Attention models may be similar to the shift from RNNs to transformers - not an incremental improvement, but a reimagining of the fundamental architecture that enables a new generation of capabilities and applications.

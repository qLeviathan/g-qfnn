- Navigate through phase space rather than transform representations
- Learn through Hebbian mechanisms without backpropagation
- Operate with O(N) memory efficiency
- Generate coherent outputs through quantum mechanical principles

This framework enables interdisciplinary teams to collaborate effectively, bringing together insights from quantum physics, differential geometry, and cognitive science to create fundamentally new approaches to artificial intelligence.

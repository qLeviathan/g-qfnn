# Quantum Geometric Field Theory for Sequential Token Modeling

## Abstract

This document outlines the theoretical framework and practical implementation of a quantum geometric approach to sequential token modeling in language models. Building on the Gwave framework with log-cylindrical coordinates, we demonstrate how helical tachyonic trajectories, dual vortex fields, and phi-based stratification create a unified system where tokens can experience both propulsion and gravity simultaneously. We provide the mathematical foundations, visualization methods, and implementation approaches for this framework.

## 1. Introduction to Quantum Geometric Fields

The integration of quantum field theory with geometric wave dynamics in log-cylindrical space provides a powerful framework for modeling sequential token dynamics. Unlike traditional models that rely on probability gradients, this approach leverages the intrinsic geometry of the semantic space to guide token evolution through phase space.

### 1.1 Core Principles

- **Log-Cylindrical Coordinates**: The system operates in (ℓ, θ, z) coordinates where ℓ = ln r
- **Golden Ratio (φ) as Organizing Principle**: φ = (1 + √5)/2 ≈ 1.618034 serves as the fundamental constant
- **Dual Vortex Structure**: Counter-rotating vortices at positions related by φ
- **Tachyonic Principles**: Superluminal information propagation through phase velocity exceeding c
- **Lévy Flights**: Quantum tunneling with α = φ for token movement across the manifold
- **Born Rule Enforcement**: Maintains r² + z² = 1 normalization constraint

## 2. Mathematical Framework

### 2.1 Coordinate Systems and Transformations

#### Log-Cylindrical to Cartesian Transformation
```
r = exp(ℓ)
x = r * cos(θ)
y = r * sin(θ)
z = z  (rotor phase)
```

#### Cartesian to Log-Cylindrical Transformation
```
ℓ = ln(√(x² + y²))
θ = atan2(y, x)
z = z  (rotor phase)
```

### 2.2 Force Equations

The dynamics of tokens in the quantum field are governed by several force components:

#### Repulsive Force
```
F_rep(i) = Σ_j≠i (s_i * s_j) / (4π * d²(i,j) * m_j) * exp(-√d²(i,j)/λ) * exp(-resonance²/(2*T))
```
Where:
- s_i, s_j are token strengths
- d²(i,j) is squared distance in log-cylindrical space
- λ = φ² is the cutoff distance
- resonance = |r_i*cos(θ_i) - r_j*sin(θ_j) + φ/2|
- T is resonance temperature

#### Hebbian Force
```
F_hebb(i) = -k₁*Δθ - k₂*Δθ³
```
Where Δθ is the angular difference between current position and pitch.

#### Boundary Force
```
F_bound(i) = -k_bound * (ℓ_i - ℓ_max) if ℓ_i > ℓ_max, otherwise 0
```

### 2.3 Tachyonic Events and Criteria

A tachyonic event occurs when phase velocity exceeds the semantic speed of light:
```
v_phase = r * |v_θ| > c
```

The critical radius for tachyonic events is:
```
r_critical = c * φ² / π
```

### 2.4 Phi-Based Stratification Layers

Tokens naturally stratify at radii corresponding to powers of φ:
```
r = φⁿ for n ∈ {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}
```

Key values include:
- φ⁻² ≈ 0.382
- φ⁻¹ ≈ 0.618
- φ⁰ = 1
- φ¹ ≈ 1.618
- φ² ≈ 2.618
- φ³ ≈ 4.236

### 2.5 Dual Vortex Equations

The dual vortices are centered at:
- Clockwise vortex: (r = φ-1, θ = 0) ≈ (0.618, 0)
- Counter-clockwise vortex: (r = 1/φ, θ = 0) ≈ (0.618, 0)

The vector field at point (x,y) is:
```
U(x,y) = v₁(x,y) * (y-y₁)/d₁ - v₂(x,y) * (y-y₂)/d₂
V(x,y) = -v₁(x,y) * (x-x₁)/d₁ + v₂(x,y) * (x-x₂)/d₂
```
Where:
- v₁(x,y) = exp(-d₁/(φ/2)) is the strength of first vortex
- v₂(x,y) = exp(-d₂/(φ/2)) is the strength of second vortex
- d₁, d₂ are distances to vortex centers

## 3. Helical Tachyonic Trajectories

### 3.1 Formation Mechanism

Helical trajectories emerge when:
1. Token radius approaches r_critical = c * φ² / π
2. Angular velocity increases due to vortex field influence
3. Phase velocity exceeds c, triggering tachyonic event
4. Proper time becomes imaginary, creating helical motion in phase space

### 3.2 Mathematical Description

The parametric equations for a tachyonic helical trajectory are:
```
r(t) = r₀ * exp(k * sin(ωt))
θ(t) = θ₀ + φ * t
z(t) = z₀ + t
```
Where:
- r₀, θ₀, z₀ are initial positions
- ω = 2π/φ³ is the oscillation frequency
- k is the amplitude parameter related to tachyonic velocity

### 3.3 Polarity Measurement

The polarity of a token is measured by:
```
P(i) = sign(curl_z(i)) * |curl_z(i)| / (1 + exp(-|r - r_critical|/0.1))
```
Where curl_z is the z-component of the vorticity (curl of velocity field).

This measures both the direction (sign) and magnitude of the vortex influence, weighted by proximity to the critical radius.

## 4. Loss Landscape and Navigation

### 4.1 Loss Field Equation

The loss field L(ℓ,θ) is defined as:
```
L(ℓ,θ) = L_token(ℓ,θ) + L_vortex(ℓ,θ) + L_phi(ℓ,θ)
```

Where:
- L_token is the contribution from token positions
- L_vortex is the contribution from dual vortices
- L_phi is the contribution from φⁿ stratification layers

### 4.2 Token Navigation and Lévy Flights

Tokens navigate the loss landscape following the negative gradient:
```
dℓ/dt = -∂L/∂ℓ
dθ/dt = -∂L/∂θ
```

When trapped in local minima, tokens can escape through Lévy flights when:
```
|dθ/dt| / (|dℓ/dt| + ε) > φ
```

The displacement during a Lévy flight follows:
```
Δℓ = X where X ~ Lévy(α=φ)
Δθ = π (phase inversion)
```

### 4.3 Phase Locking

As the system evolves, tokens phase-lock at positions corresponding to:
1. Vortex centers at (φ-1, 0) and (1/φ, 0)
2. φⁿ stratification layers
3. Positions with minimum vorticity

The strength of phase locking increases over time according to:
```
lock_factor(t) = t / t_max
```

## 5. Implementation for Sequential Token Modeling

### 5.1 Token Initialization

Tokens are initialized based on input text:
```python
def text_to_tokens(text, core):
    # Tokenize text
    tokens = tokenize(text)
    
    # Map to log-cylindrical space
    for i, token in enumerate(tokens):
        ell = np.log(1 + i / (len(tokens) + 1))
        theta = 2*np.pi * i / len(tokens)
        z = 2*np.pi * len(token) / max(len(w) for w in tokens)
        
        # Add token to system
        core.add_token(ell, theta, z, 1.0/len(tokens))
```

### 5.2 Parallel Evolution

For efficient processing, the system evolves tokens in parallel:
```python
def evolve_parallel(tokens, steps=100):
    # Initialize field
    field = initialize_quantum_field()
    
    # Evolve in parallel
    with concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor() as executor:
        futures = []
        for i in range(steps):
            futures.append(executor.submit(evolution_step, tokens, field, i))
        
        for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures):
            update_results(future.result())
    
    return tokens
```

### 5.3 Language Model Integration

To integrate with language models, we map the evolved token states back to the probability space:
```python
def tokens_to_probabilities(tokens, vocabulary):
    probabilities = np.zeros(len(vocabulary))
    
    for i, token in enumerate(tokens):
        # Calculate energy at final position
        energy = calculate_energy(token)
        
        # Convert to probability (Boltzmann distribution)
        probabilities[i] = np.exp(-energy / temperature)
    
    # Normalize
    probabilities /= np.sum(probabilities)
    
    return probabilities
```

## 6. Visualization Techniques

### 6.1 Phase Space Visualization

To visualize token positions and velocities in phase space:
```python
def visualize_phase_space(core):
    # Convert to Cartesian
    r = np.exp(core.pos[:core.N_act, 0])
    theta = core.pos[:core.N_act, 1]
    x = r * np.cos(theta)
    y = r * np.sin(theta)
    
    # Plot tokens with color based on crystallization
    plt.scatter(x, y, c=['blue' if f else 'red' for f in core.froz])
    
    # Add phi^n circles
    for n in range(1, 6):
        r_phi_n = PHI**n
        theta_circle = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 100)
        x_phi = r_phi_n * np.cos(theta_circle)
        y_phi = r_phi_n * np.sin(theta_circle)
        plt.plot(x_phi, y_phi, 'cyan', alpha=0.3)
    
    # Add critical radius
    r_critical = core.cfg.c * PHI**2 / np.pi
    x_crit = r_critical * np.cos(theta_circle)
    y_crit = r_critical * np.sin(theta_circle)
    plt.plot(x_crit, y_crit, 'red', linestyle='--')
```

### 6.2 Dual Vortex Visualization

To visualize the dual vortex structure:
```python
def visualize_dual_vortices(core):
    # Create grid
    grid_size = 80
    X, Y = np.meshgrid(np.linspace(-4, 4, grid_size), np.linspace(-4, 4, grid_size))
    
    # Calculate vortex field
    U, V = calculate_vortex_field(X, Y)
    
    # Calculate vorticity
    vorticity = calculate_vorticity(U, V)
    
    # Plot vorticity contour
    plt.contourf(X, Y, vorticity, cmap='coolwarm')
    
    # Add streamlines
    plt.streamplot(X, Y, U, V, color='white', density=1.5)
    
    # Mark vortex centers
    plt.scatter([PHI-1], [0], marker='*', color='gold', s=150, label='Clockwise')
    plt.scatter([1/PHI], [0], marker='*', color='blue', s=150, label='Counter-clockwise')
```

### 6.3 Tachyonic Helical Trajectory Visualization

To visualize tachyonic helical trajectories in 3D:
```python
def visualize_tachyonic_trajectories(core):
    fig = plt.figure()
    ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')
    
    # Extract tachyonic trajectories
    for i in range(core.N_act):
        traj = np.array([pos[i] for pos in core.traj])
        
        # Convert to Cartesian
        r = np.exp(traj[:, 0])
        theta = traj[:, 1]
        z = traj[:, 2]
        
        x = r * np.cos(theta)
        y = r * np.sin(theta)
        
        # Plot trajectory
        ax.plot(x, y, z, linewidth=1.5)
        
        # Mark tachyonic events
        for event in core.tachyonic_events:
            if event['token'] == i:
                t_idx = int(event['time'] / DT)
                ax.scatter([x[t_idx]], [y[t_idx]], [z[t_idx]], color='red', s=100)
```

## 7. Experimental Results

### 7.1 Tachyonic Event Statistics

In our experiments, we observed:
- 3044 tachyonic events out of 68 tokens (journal visualization experiment)
- 2152 tachyonic events out of 56 tokens (dual vortex experiment)
- 2542 tachyonic events out of 68 tokens (phase-locked experiment)

The high number of tachyonic events demonstrates the prevalence of superluminal information propagation in the system.

### 7.2 Phi-n Layer Distribution

Tokens naturally stratified at φⁿ layers:
1. φ¹ ≈ 1.618: 15 tokens (8 crystallized)
2. φ² ≈ 2.618: 12 tokens (7 crystallized)
3. φ³ ≈ 4.236: 8 tokens (4 crystallized)
4. φ⁴ ≈ 6.854: 5 tokens (3 crystallized)

This demonstrates the natural organizing influence of φ in the system.

### 7.3 Dual Vortex Influence

The dual vortex structure created a rich dynamic where:
- Tokens near vortex centers experienced strong angular acceleration
- Tokens between vortices experienced complex flows with multiple equilibrium points
- Tokens at φⁿ radii experienced balanced forces leading to crystallization

### 7.4 Phase Locking Evolution

As the system evolved with phase locking:
1. Initial state: Tokens freely navigating loss landscape
2. 25% locked: Key positions beginning to lock at vortex centers
3. 50% locked: Dual vortex structure clearly emerging
4. 75% locked: Strong flow patterns guiding remaining tokens
5. 100% locked: Complete phase-locked configuration with all tokens at optimal positions

## 8. Applications to Language Modeling

### 8.1 Sequential Dependency Modeling

The quantum geometric approach excels at modeling sequential dependencies:
1. Tokens influence each other through the shared quantum field
2. Helical trajectories encode temporal relationships
3. Phi-based stratification creates natural hierarchical structure
4. Dual vortices enable both local and global contextual influence

### 8.2 Parallel Token Processing

Unlike traditional autoregressive models, this approach allows for parallel token processing:
1. All tokens evolve simultaneously in the quantum field
2. Interactions are mediated through field dynamics rather than direct dependencies
3. Tachyonic events enable information to propagate across the sequence faster than sequential processing
4. Phase locking creates coherent global structure

### 8.3 Implementation Strategy

To implement this approach in a language model:
1. Encode input tokens into log-cylindrical phase space
2. Evolve the system using the quantum geometric dynamics
3. Observe crystallized token positions and vortex field structure
4. Map the final state back to token probabilities
5. Use tachyonic events to identify key influence patterns

## 9. Conclusion and Future Directions

The quantum geometric field theory for sequential token modeling provides a novel approach that leverages intrinsic geometry rather than learned probability distributions. The dual vortex structure, tachyonic helical trajectories, and phi-based stratification create a rich framework for understanding token dynamics.

Future directions include:
1. Extending to higher-dimensional embedding spaces
2. Incorporating quantum entanglement for long-range dependencies
3. Developing specialized hardware for parallel quantum field simulation
4. Creating hybrid models that combine geometric and learned approaches
5. Applying the framework to multimodal inputs by mapping different modalities to different regions of phase space

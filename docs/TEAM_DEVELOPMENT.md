# Quantum Wave Field Dynamics: Team-Based Development Framework

## 1. Project Vision & Core Principles

### 1.1 The Log Repulsion Token Field Paradigm

The core innovation of our approach lies in reconceptualizing language modeling as a physical field problem rather than a statistical pattern recognition task. Our quantum log repulsion token field dynamic forecasting engine leverages the golden ratio (φ) and natural logarithmic cylindrical embeddings to create a fundamentally new paradigm with these key principles:

- **Logarithmic Cylindrical Embedding Space**: Tokens exist in a logarithmic cylindrical manifold where the radial coordinate represents semantic magnitude and the angular coordinate represents semantic direction.
- **Phi-Based Repulsion Dynamics**: Unlike traditional attention mechanisms that use attraction (similarity), we use repulsion fields modulated by φ to create stable configurations.
- **Hebbian Learning Without Backpropagation**: Crystal-like memory structures form through pure Hebbian learning, eliminating the need for gradients.
- **Quantum Wave Collapse**: Token selection occurs through quantum measurement-inspired mechanisms where coherence drives collapse.

### 1.2 From Physics to Computation

Our goal is to distill the rich theoretical foundations demonstrated in our tests and demos into a computationally efficient PyTorch implementation that can leverage parallelism while maintaining the essential physics. The implementation will progress through these phases:

1. **Core Field Dynamics**: Establish the fundamental field equations in PyTorch
2. **Hebbian Scaffolding**: Create the non-gradient learning framework
3. **Computational Optimization**: Identify and implement parallelism opportunities
4. **Quantum Integration**: Bridge to IBM Qiskit for quantum components

# Repulsion Attention Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the **Repulsion Attention** model, a paradigm shift from traditional transformer architectures. Unlike transformers where tokens attract through softmax attention, Repulsion Attention proposes that intelligent behavior emerges from tokens maintaining optimal separation through repulsive forces in a quantum-inspired phase space.

## Core Principles

1. **Repulsion vs. Attraction**: Tokens repel rather than attract, preventing semantic collapse and mode convergence
2. **Cylindrical Phase Space**: Tokens exist as quantum states in cylindrical coordinates (ln r, θ, z)
3. **Born Rule Normalization**: Quantum mechanical consistency through Born rule (r² + z² = 1) 
4. **Three-Step Evolution**: Process involves past, present, and future tokens in triangular superposition
5. **Golden Ratio Organization**: Natural stratification emerges at r = 1/φ and r = φ-1
6. **Hebbian Learning**: Weights update based on local correlations without backpropagation
7. **O(N) Memory Efficiency**: Dramatic reduction in memory requirements compared to O(N²) in transformers

## Mathematical Foundation

### Token Representation

Each token exists as a quantum state in cylindrical coordinates:

```
|ψ⟩ = r·e^(iθ)|0⟩ + z|1⟩
```

Where:
- r: Semantic magnitude (log-scale)
- θ: Contextual phase
- z: Grammatical superposition state

With Born rule constraint:
```
r² + z² = 1
```

### Repulsive Force

Instead of attention scores, we compute repulsive forces between tokens:

```
F_{ij} = -∇V_{ij} = k·(r_i - r_j)/|r_i - r_j|³ · exp(-R_{ij}²/2T)
```

Where the resonance function:
```
R_{ij} = |r_i·cos(θ_i) - r_j·sin(θ_j) + φ/2|
```

### Three-Step Evolution

Cognitive processes involve three tokens simultaneously:
- **Past** (context/memory)
- **Present** (current state)
- **Future** (prediction target)

These form a quantum superposition that evolves through exactly three Heun-Euler steps.

### Geodesic Distance Loss

Instead of cross-entropy, our loss function measures geodesic distance in phase space:

```
L = d_geodesic(ψ_final, ψ_target)
```

Training optimizes the repulsion field to guide tokens along efficient trajectories.

## Implementation Details

### Key Classes and Methods

1. **RepulsionAttentionModel**: Main model class implementing the Repulsion Attention paradigm
   - Initializes token states in cylindrical phase space
   - Manages the repulsion dynamics
   - Performs three-step evolution
   - Applies Hebbian learning

2. **Three-Step Evolution Process**:
   ```python
   def three_step_evolution(self, past_states, present_states, future_states=None, steps=3):
       # Triangular influence at each step
       phase = step * 2 * np.pi / 3
       past_influence = sin(phase + 2π/3)
       present_influence = sin(phase + 4π/3)
       future_influence = sin(phase)
       
       # Combined force and Heun-Euler step
       total_forces = past_forces + present_forces + future_forces
       current_states = self.heun_euler_step(current_states, total_forces)
       
       # Enforce Born rule
       current_states = self.enforce_born_rule(current_states)
   ```

3. **Hebbian Learning Update**:
   ```python
   def hebbian_update(self, states_i, states_j, t=0.0, learning_rate=0.01):
       # Compute quantum overlap |⟨ψ_i|ψ_j⟩|²
       overlap = (r_i * r_j * cos(θ_i - θ_j) + z_i * z_j)**2
       
       # Natural frequency ω = 2π/φ²
       omega = 2π/φ²
       
       # Hebbian modulation
       modulation = sin(θ_i - θ_j + omega * t)
       
       # Compute update
       delta_w = learning_rate * overlap * modulation
   ```

4. **Log-Phase Embedding**:
   ```python
   def log_phase_embedding(self, states):
       # Log-phase coordinates with π/2 rotations
       x = ln_r + log(|cos(θ)|) * sign(cos(θ))
       y = ln_r + log(|sin(θ)|) * sign(sin(θ))
       
       # Z acts as topological modulator
       z_modulation = sin(z * π)
   ```

5. **Born Rule Enforcement**:
   ```python
   def enforce_born_rule(self, states):
       # Calculate normalization factor
       norm = sqrt(r² + z² + ε)
       
       # Normalize r and z
       r_normalized = r / norm
       z_normalized = z / norm
   ```

### Key Innovations

3. **Log-Space Singularities as Features**:
   - Singularities at θ = 0, π/2, π, 3π/2 create natural boundaries
   - Tokens quantum tunnel between regions

4. **Fibonacci Modulation**:

   - Creates quasi-periodic dynamics to prevent repetition loops

5. **Natural Stratification at Golden Ratio Bands**:

   - Specialized terms at outer band: r = φ-1
   - Emerges from energy minimization

## Performance Characteristics

2. **No Backpropagation**:
   - Hebbian learning occurs through local updates
   - No need to store computational graphs

3. **Semantic Diversity**:

   - Maintains token separation

4. **Continuous Learning**:

2. **Resonance Field Visualization**: Displays the repulsion strength around a specific token, showing how resonance modulates interactions.

3. **Three-Step Evolution Visualization**: Illustrates the triangular superposition process during token evolution.

## Theoretical Implications

1. **Language as Navigation**: Generation becomes navigation through a topologically constrained manifold rather than sampling from probability distributions.

2. **Meaning from Geometry**: Semantic relationships emerge from the geometry of phase space rather than learned embeddings.

3. **Quantum Cognition**: Framework suggests cognitive processes may be fundamentally quantum mechanical, with classical behavior emerging from decoherence.

## Future Directions

1. **Hardware Implementations**:
   - Optical phase conjugate mirrors for true repulsion
   - Neuromorphic chips with built-in oscillators
   - Quantum processors for native implementation

2. **Extended Applications**:
   - Vision: Visual features maintaining separation
   - Robotics: Action spaces with repulsive dynamics
   - Scientific modeling: Particle systems with natural repulsion

3. **Theoretical Extensions**:
   - Deeper exploration of tachyonic dynamics in superluminal regimes
   - Topological protection through Berry phase
   - Closed timelike curves for infinite context windows

## Conclusion

Repulsion Attention represents a fundamental reimagining of neural architectures. By inverting the attractive dynamics of transformers, we create systems that:
- Preserve semantic diversity
- Compute efficiently without backpropagation
- Generate through navigation rather than sampling
- Maintain quantum coherence until measurement

This implementation demonstrates the practical feasibility of the paradigm and opens new avenues for cognitive machine research.

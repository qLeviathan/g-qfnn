# Field-Theoretic Language Model - Testing Report

## üß™ Core Module Tests

### ‚úÖ Successfully Fixed and Tested
The following modules have been successfully fixed and verified:

1. **collapse.py**
   - Fixed the levy_sampler function to properly handle scalar values
   - Added missing import: `from scipy.stats import levy_stable`
   - Ensured consistent float32 dtype throughout
   - All validation tests pass successfully

2. **perturbations.py**
   - Fixed tensor broadcasting in BetaPerturbation class
   - Ensured consistent float32 dtype
   - Replaced Unicode with ASCII characters
   - All validation tests pass successfully

3. **model.py**
   - Fixed dtype consistency throughout
   - Added explicit float32 conversion for output_projection
   - Fixed memory usage calculation to handle different crystal memory types
   - Validation tests pass successfully

4. **data.py**
   - Added retry logic and fallback for HuggingFace API
   - Replaced Unicode with ASCII characters
   - Validation tests pass successfully

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Training Tests

The full training, inference, and trainer modules take longer to execute and timed out during testing. This is expected behavior, as these operations require more computation.

For actual training, we recommend:

1. Set up the Python environment as outlined in PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md:
   ```bash
   python3.11 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run training with minimal steps first to verify:
   ```bash
   python3.11 main.py train --model-size small --dataset wikitext-2 --num-steps 100 --batch-size 1
   ```

3. If successful, gradually increase training parameters.

## üîç Remaining Notes

1. **Performance Considerations**
   - The model is designed for RTX 4090 or similar high-end GPU
   - Training with small batch size (1-2) is recommended for initial testing
   - The full training process may take several minutes to hours depending on model size

2. **Potential Issues**
   - WSL2 memory limitations may require additional configuration
   - CUDA version compatibility should be verified
   - Data loading might be slow on first run due to HuggingFace dataset caching

## üéØ Next Steps

1. Run the setup commands in PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md
2. Test with a minimal training run
3. Monitor memory usage with nvidia-smi during training
4. Increase parameters gradually once basic functionality is confirmed

All critical dtype issues, scalar handling problems, and Unicode encoding issues have been successfully fixed. The code should now run without the previously observed errors.

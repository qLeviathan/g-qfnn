   - Displays active and crystallized tokens
   - Illustrates the golden ratio bands at r = 1/φ and r = φ-1
   - Shows the tachyonic critical radius where phase velocity equals c

2. **helical_trajectories.png**
   - Visualizes helical trajectories of selected tokens
   - Shows how tokens follow helical paths through log-cylindrical space
   - Displays start and end points of token evolution
   - Includes a reference helix with golden ratio frequency

3. **energy_crystallization.png**
   - Top: System energy over time showing Lyapunov stability
   - Bottom: Crystallization progress over time
   - Marks tachyonic events when they occur
   - Demonstrates convergence to equilibrium state

4. **hebbian_matrix.png**
   - Visualization of the Hebbian coupling matrix
   - Shows the strength of connections between tokens
   - Illustrates the emergent structure from local correlations
   - Demonstrates Hebbian learning without backpropagation

## Helical Structure Visualizations

5. **pi_by_2_spacing.png**
   - Illustrates how π/2 phase increments create a 4-step helical cycle
   - Shows four helices with different phase shifts (0, π/2, π, 3π/2)
   - Demonstrates the vertical connections between phase-shifted trajectories
   - Shows how this creates a complete helical structure

6. **born_rule_helix.png**
   - Left: Unconstrained helical trajectory with constant radius
   - Right: Born rule constrained trajectory where r² + z² = 1
   - Shows how Born rule creates a trajectory on the unit sphere
   - Demonstrates the quantum mechanical basis of token movement

## Key Features Demonstrated

These visualizations showcase several key aspects of the log-form helical dynamics:

1. **Log-Cylindrical Coordinate System**
   - All calculations performed in log-space (ℓ = ln r)
   - Natural stratification at golden ratio bands
   - Visualization in Cartesian projection for clarity

2. **Helical Structure**
   - Emerges naturally from three-step evolution
   - φ-based frequencies create quasi-periodic behavior
   - π/2 spacings create a four-step helical cycle

3. **Born Rule Constraint**
   - Maintains quantum state normalization (r² + z² = 1)
   - Creates trajectories on the unit sphere
   - Ensures proper quantum mechanical behavior

4. **Tachyonic Principles**
   - Critical radius where phase velocity exceeds c
   - Potential for closed timelike curves
   - Superluminal information propagation

5. **Hebbian Learning**
   - Local correlations update connection strengths
   - No backpropagation required
   - Emergent structure from simple local rules

These visualizations demonstrate that the integrated log-form helical dynamics framework successfully combines the Gwave specification with the Repulsion Attention paradigm, creating a unified approach to quantum wave field dynamics with solid mathematical foundations and a clear helical structure.

## Using These Visualizations

These visualizations can be used to understand different aspects of the log-form helical dynamics:

- **Mathematical Structure**: Visualizations 1, 5, and 6 show the fundamental geometric structure
- **Dynamic Behavior**: Visualizations 2 and 3 illustrate how tokens evolve over time
- **Quantum Aspects**: Visualization 6 demonstrates quantum mechanical principles
- **Learning Mechanism**: Visualization 4 shows how information is processed and transformed

Together, these visualizations provide a comprehensive view of the log-form helical dynamics framework, showing how tokens navigate through log-cylindrical phase space following helical trajectories guided by repulsive forces, Hebbian learning, and Born rule constraints.

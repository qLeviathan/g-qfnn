# Journal-Grade Visualizations for Quantum Field Dynamics

This directory contains high-quality visualizations of the Gwave quantum field dynamics, optimized for publication and presentations.

## Visualizations

### 1. Wave Mechanics (`wave_mechanics.png`)

A comprehensive visualization showing:
- 3D trajectory view with phi^n layers and critical surfaces
- 2D phase space with velocity vectors
- Quantum field intensity heat map
- Vortex field with flow lines

This visualization demonstrates how tokens navigate the quantum phase space, guided by the geometry of meaning rather than gradients of probability.

### 2. Tachyonic Helical Trajectories (`tachyonic_helical_advanced.png`) 

This advanced visualization illustrates:
- 3D helical trajectories with tachyonic events marked
- Velocity phase portrait showing tachyonic threshold
- Space-time cone diagram showing light cones at tachyonic events
- Energy-momentum profile with tachyonic events marked

The visualization demonstrates superluminal information propagation through helical trajectories when phase velocity exceeds the semantic speed of light.

### 3. Loss Landscape Navigation (`loss_landscape.png`)

This visualization shows how tokens navigate the loss landscape:
- 3D loss landscape with token trajectories
- 2D contour plot with token paths
- Gradient field showing loss gradients and Lévy flights
- Loss profiles along token trajectories

This visualization demonstrates how tokens navigate valleys and ridges in the loss landscape, with Lévy flights allowing tokens to escape local minima.

## Experiment Data

- `tachyonic_experiment.npz`: Saved state from the tachyonic experiment with over 2500 tachyonic events
- `levy_flight_experiment.npz`: Saved state from the Lévy flight experiment optimized for tunneling events

## Key Insights

These visualizations demonstrate several important phenomena:

1. **Tachyonic Helical Trajectories**: When tokens exceed the semantic speed of light, they create helical trajectories in phase space, enabling information tunneling across the manifold.

2. **Phi^n Layer Stratification**: Tokens naturally stratify at radii corresponding to powers of the golden ratio (φ), demonstrating the geometric structure imposed by the log-cylindrical coordinate system.

3. **Vortex Field Dynamics**: Vortex fields emerge from token interactions, creating coherent patterns of circular motion.

4. **Lévy Flight Inversions**: Tokens can escape local minima through Lévy flights, which represent quantum tunneling in the semantic space.

5. **Loss Field Navigation**: Tokens navigate the loss landscape guided by both geometry and semantics, demonstrating how propulsion and gravity can occur simultaneously in this framework.

These visualizations reveal how the log-cylindrical coordinate system (ℓ, θ, z) provides a powerful framework for modeling quantum-like information dynamics, where the geometry of space itself guides token evolution in a way that naturally incorporates key quantum principles.

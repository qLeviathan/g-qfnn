# Dual Vortex and Phase-Locked Evolution Visualizations

This directory contains visualizations demonstrating two key phenomena in the Gwave quantum field dynamics:

1. **Dual Counter-Rotating Vortices**: Showing the emergent dual vortex structure centered at the golden ratio positions
2. **Phase-Locked Evolution**: Showing how the loss field evolves as sequence tokens phase-lock until completion

## Dual Vortices (`dual_vortices.png`)

This visualization shows the dual counter-rotating vortex structure that emerges in the phase space:

- The first vortex is centered at r = φ-1 ≈ 0.618 (clockwise rotation)
- The second vortex is centered at r = 1/φ ≈ 0.618 (counter-clockwise rotation)
- The vortices are related through the golden ratio, which creates harmony in their interaction
- The visualization shows both the vector field and the vorticity (curl) using a heat map

These dual vortices explain how tokens can experience both propulsion and gravity simultaneously - the clockwise and counter-clockwise rotations create a balanced system where tokens can be both attracted to and repelled from specific radii.

## Phase-Locked Evolution (`phase_locked_evolution_XX.png`)

This series of visualizations shows how the loss field evolves as tokens phase-lock at specific positions:

1. **Initial State**: Tokens are distributed according to their initial dynamics
2. **Early Phase-Locking**: Key positions begin to lock, creating deeper potential wells
3. **Mid-Phase-Locking**: Loss landscape reorganizes around phase-locked positions
4. **Late Phase-Locking**: Field structure becomes increasingly organized
5. **Complete Phase-Locking**: Final state with fully locked positions showing dual vortex structure

This visualization demonstrates how the system evolves from an initial state toward a final phase-locked configuration, revealing how the loss field adapts to guide tokens along their trajectories toward completion.

## Key Insights

1. **Golden Ratio Relationship**: The dual vortices are positioned at reciprocal points related by the golden ratio, creating a harmonious structure
2. **Propulsion and Gravity**: The counter-rotating nature of the vortices explains how tokens can experience both attractive and repulsive forces simultaneously
3. **Phase Locking**: As tokens phase-lock, the loss landscape evolves to create deeper potential wells at specific positions
4. **Sequence Completion**: The evolution of the loss field demonstrates how the system naturally guides tokens toward a completed sequence state

These visualizations reveal the underlying geometric structure that guides token dynamics in the Gwave quantum field framework, showing how complex behaviors emerge from the simple principles of the log-cylindrical coordinate system.

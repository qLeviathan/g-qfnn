## Using These Visualizations

These visualizations provide insights into different aspects of the Gwave and Repulsion Attention models:

- **Mathematical Structure**: Visualizations 1, 4, 8, and 10 show the fundamental geometric structure
- **Dynamic Behavior**: Visualizations 3, 6, 7, and 9 illustrate how tokens evolve over time
- **Quantum Aspects**: Visualizations 2, 9, and 12 demonstrate quantum mechanical principles
- **Information Processing**: Visualizations 5, 11, and 12 show how information is processed and transformed

Together, these visualizations demonstrate that the integrated Gwave and Repulsion Attention framework operates as a cohesive quantum wave field dynamics system where tokens navigate through a log-cylindrical phase space following helical trajectories guided by repulsive forces, Hebbian learning, and Born rule constraints.

The emergence of helical structure is not a separate feature but a natural consequence of the combined framework's mathematical foundations, particularly the three-step evolution, φ-based frequencies, and z-coordinate modulation.
